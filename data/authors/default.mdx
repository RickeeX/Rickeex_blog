Hey, welcome.

I crafted this digital sanctuary with passion. Feel free to wander around.


***
### I am:

- No, I refuse to write such a thing.

- In our attempt to define ourselves, we are in fact succumbing to an inner voice that screams for deliverance: "Release me, quench my creativity and passion, grant me a place to stand, let me abandon the resistance and cease to drift in the eternal predicament of identity." In mathematics, a clear definition is the axiom of truth; for a human being, it is the first step to mediocrity, which, in turn, is the certain path to annihilation.

- That's a joke. I'm a normal person with nothing in particular to mention about.


### I like:

- Piano (and recently JAZZ improvision very much), Choir (once a piano accompany), A capella (email me and we can make noises!)

- All sorts of outdoor activities. Eg.: hiking (now planning a trip to the Mount Everest!), sailing (former member of Voilà Sailing Club), enjoying the air-con in supermarkets (wait this is en fait indoor)

- Do things on a whim (like this website 😉)!

- Dive in random researches on a whim (like these topics 😉)!

### I dream of:

- Living a million vibrant lives (while awake!)

- Justice and Peace.
